"""Native-Dep Mirror — Stage 2 Triage substep A3.5 (AS2 tracked tool).

Mirrors an issue's body `### Dependencies` field FS+0d subset to GitHub's native
issue-dependency surface (`blocked-by`), per the one-way body→native mirror model
(body is authoritative; native is a projected display surface). This is the
AS2-promoted form of the A3.5 mirror procedure previously specified only as
pseudocode in the Stage 2 triage shard (agent-script promotion framework §1 — see
the promotion decision line in the promoting PR).

Mirror contract (Model A — body→native one-way; the authoritative spec lives in
release/references/specs/ticket-information-architecture.md § Native Dependencies):
  - Eligible body deps: `FS+0d #N` on a **Blocked by: / Depends on:** segment ONLY
    (default / untyped `#N` normalizes to FS+0d). The Dependencies section is a
    labeled-segment grammar — a `#N` on a **Blocks:** segment is the RECIPROCAL
    ("current blocks #N", not "current blocked-by #N") and is NOT mirrored as a
    current-issue blocked-by; a `#N` on a **Relates to: / sibling / pairs** segment
    is non-blocking and is NOT mirrored at all. Non-FS-zero-lag types (`SS`, `FF`,
    `SF`, `FS±Nd`) are body-only by design — native `blocks`/`blocked-by` has only
    one semantic and cannot express them, so they are NEVER mirrored. (Direction-
    blind parsing of `Blocks:` / `Relates to:` targets was the #662 Blocker —
    it inverted edges and wrote false native blocked-by dependencies.)
  - UNLABELLED PROSE IS NOT A DEPENDENCY CLAIM. A Dependencies section whose text
    carries no direction label yields NO mirror-eligible edge: prose states no
    direction, so asserting one is invention. The bare-`#N` backward-compat shim
    applies ONLY to the legacy bare-ref list form it was written for (`- #46`),
    never to free-form sentences. Such refs are reported as `unattributed` so a
    real dependency stated only in prose surfaces for relabelling instead of being
    silently dropped. An epic / parent reference is a sub-issue relationship, not a
    dependency, and is never mirror-eligible in EITHER position — unlabelled prose
    ("Part of epic #N") or trailing a still-open `Blocked by:` segment.
  - to_add  = eligible body deps NOT present in native blocked-by → add via the
    GraphQL `addBlockedBy` mutation, falling back to the REST dependencies
    endpoint when that call fails (body wins; auto-resolve).
  - drift   = native blocked-by NOT present in eligible body deps → FLAGGED for
    operator review; body is NOT auto-modified (body remains authoritative).
  - Idempotent: re-running with the same body state is a no-op (modulo the API's
    eventual-consistency window).

Gate posture: A3.5 is NOT gate-blocking. G2-04 (dependency state validation) is
the gate; this mirror is an additive sync step whose failures surface for operator
awareness but do not block the Phase B verdict.

Usage:
  # Mirror a single issue (resolves repo from the cwd's gh context):
  python3 native-dep-mirror.py --issue 662

  # Mirror every open issue in a milestone:
  python3 native-dep-mirror.py --milestone "69-triage-and-bundling-signals"

  # Explicit repo (OWNER/NAME); else resolved via `gh repo view`:
  python3 native-dep-mirror.py --issue 662 --repo OWNER/pmo-platform

  # Plan only — compute + print the mirror plan, perform NO native writes:
  python3 native-dep-mirror.py --issue 662 --dry-run

  # JSON plan/result (machine-consumable):
  python3 native-dep-mirror.py --issue 662 --output-format json

  # Fixture self-test (no network; exercises the deterministic core):
  python3 native-dep-mirror.py --self-test

  # Write-surface smoke check — introspect the schema, write nothing, exit
  # non-zero if the mirror has no usable write path at all:
  python3 native-dep-mirror.py --verify-write-surface

Exit codes:
  0 — mirror completed (or dry-run plan produced) with no add failures
  1 — one or more native add operations failed on an EDGE-level cause (dep cap,
      per-issue permission, transient API); operator awareness, non-gating
  2 — API / network / scope failure resolving repo or reading issue/native deps,
      OR a CONTRACT-level write failure (the write surface itself is broken —
      e.g. the mutation field is absent from the schema AND the REST fallback
      also failed). A contract breach is deliberately NOT reported as exit 1:
      conflating "this API no longer exists" with "this one edge failed" is what
      let a dead write path run unnoticed across releases.

# DIRECTION IS SEGMENT-SCOPED (#662 Blocker fix). The live body format (rendered
# from improvement.yml's `Dependencies` field) is a labeled-segment grammar, NOT a
# flat "every `#N` is a blocker" list. A single Dependencies section commonly reads:
#
#     Blocked by: — · Blocks: #213 · Relates to: #149, #61
#
# Only `#N` on a **Blocked by: / Depends on:** segment means "current issue IS
# blocked-by #N" (the mirror-eligible direction → native blocked-by(current ← #N)).
# A `#N` on a **Blocks:** segment is the RECIPROCAL ("current BLOCKS #N") — mirroring
# it as blocked-by(current ← #N) INVERTS the edge (the #662 defect: #225's
# `Blocks: #213` was being asserted as "225 blocked-by 213", the opposite of truth).
# `#N` on a relates/sibling/pairs/parent segment is a NON-blocking relationship and
# is never mirrored. Per the sibling precedent bundle-issues-parser.py
# (`derive_artifact_relationships`: "BLOCKS is reachable only from native … in that
# degraded path no BLOCKS edge is emitted and the dependency defaults to the weakest
# correct claim"), the reciprocal-`Blocks:` edge is NOT asserted as a current-issue
# blocked-by; it is left to the target issue's own `Blocked by:` segment to express.
