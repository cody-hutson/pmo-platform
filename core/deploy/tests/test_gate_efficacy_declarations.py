"""Assert every workflow's `gate-efficacy:` header agrees with its own trigger.

WHAT THIS GUARDS, AND WHY IT EXISTS
-----------------------------------
`core/standards/gate-efficacy-standard.md` Requirement (b) obliges every workflow to
declare its skip semantics in a machine-greppable header, and § Verdict-Input Closure
makes `skip-semantics=absent-is-pass` a CLAIM ABOUT COVERAGE rather than a formality.
Two spellings of that claim exist and they are mutually exclusive:

    always-reports=yes            <=>  the workflow carries NO on.<event>.paths filter
    skip-semantics=absent-is-pass <=>  the workflow DOES carry one

Before this suite, nothing in the tree asserted that biconditional. The header and the
trigger were two independent strings that a reader kept in agreement by hand, so the
change that breaks the invariant — adding a `paths:` key without touching the header,
or deleting one and leaving `skip-semantics=absent-is-pass` behind — was exactly the
change no gate could see. A declaration nothing checks decays into a comment.

EXIT CONTRACT
-------------
    0  every workflow conforms AND the anti-vacuity harness passed
    1  at least one declared-vs-actual mismatch (or a workflow with no header)
    2  the harness itself could not assert — an unreadable population, a partition too
       small to build a mutation arm, or a mutation the detector failed to flag.
       Fail-closed: a probe that cannot demonstrate it discriminates reports 2 rather
       than the clean it can no longer distinguish from a real one.

THE HARNESS RUNS BY DEFAULT, ON EVERY INVOCATION — deliberately, and it is the whole
reason to trust the zero. A falsification harness behind a flag nothing passes runs
exactly once, at implementation, and thereafter certifies nothing. Every mutation arm
below is derived from the LIVE population at run time rather than from hardcoded
workflow names, so a rename cannot quietly empty it, and an empty partition is a
reported NOSET rather than a skipped arm.

Hermetic: reads the workflow files, mutates only in-memory copies, writes nothing.
